# P5 raycasting
Attempt at Daniel Shiffmans coding challenge.

This application is a test run of my ability to run and use javascript in order to create a raycasting object

inside of the project we have multiple classes that we will use to build a **_ player like _** object in order to simualte movement though a plain canvas while protruding rays or "sight lines".

At this time there is no unit collison but i will come back to it some day in order to add movement with the arrow keys and wall collision.

- Tech used
  - P5 js library for drwaing points on a plane/casting rays without the pain
  - express for the hosting of the server to heroku

Original solution was replaced with his as it's nicer to look at.
